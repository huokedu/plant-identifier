# Plant Identifier: A Custom Vision Sample

## Features
### Classifier-agnostic
Although the sample was built to identify plants, the only thing tying it to plants is the `<title>` tag in the HTML. Feel free to try it out with different classifiers.

### Responsive and Mobile-First Design
The app was designed to work well on phones and desktops alike. It feels at home within phone dimensions, yet seamlessly scales out to fill a larger display.
